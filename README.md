# Keyboard Smart Brackets
Requires Autohotkey.
Open "Smart Brackets.ahk" to run.
Ctrl+shift+[open bracket key] triggers the shortcuts. So Ctrl+shift+9 to create round brackets around selected text.
----

The script takes a selected string of text and uses keyboard shortcuts to wrap the string in brackets or quotation marks.
The script detects spaces and trims them before adding the punctuation. It then adds them back.

The intention is to streamline typing and the use of these punctuation marks which are rarely used in isolation.

Currently the script operates on "", (), and [].

It also responds to ctrl+b and ctrl+i to add asterisks for markdown formatting in Discord.

Two different methods of achieving the stated goals are included to see if there is a difference in reliability.
